# Binary Search Tree Depth First Search Practice

This repo is a small repo meant to practice implementing three depth first searches for a binary search tree.

The `TreeNode` class has been written for you along with some starter code for the `Tree` class. You are tasked with writing an implementation for the `preorder`, `inorder` and `postorder` traversals for a binary search tree. Remember that you may need to implement helper methods to assist in the recursion required.
